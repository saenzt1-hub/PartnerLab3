Hello! This our app, and we have added a new animation, spring!!
This animation occurs when you press the "New Game" button.
It adds a nice, fun touch and really engages players to keep playing!
We wanted to add this and the original ease in/out animations because of how fun they are,
along with how interesting they look in the game. They really stood out to us when we were learning about animations in Swift.
We already had the ease animations to add a little "bedazzle" to the game, which we thought looked really nice.
These ease animations are seen throughout the MemoryGameViewModel, ContentView, and CardView files! (Apologies, my XCode was acting out so that's why it can't be seen much in the video!!)
So, we wanted to add another one, spring!
We, Taina and Tori, hope that you find this game enjoyable!
