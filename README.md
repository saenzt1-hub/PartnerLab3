Hello! This our app, and we have added a new animation, spring!!
This animation occurs when you press the "New Game" button.
It adds a nice, fun touch and really engages players to keep playing!
We wanted to add this and the original ease in/out animations because of how fun they are,
along with how interesting they look in the game. They really stood out to us when we were learning about animations in Swift.
We, Taina and Tori, hope that you find this game enjoyable!
