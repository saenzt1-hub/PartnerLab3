Structure/Code:

Hello! This is our app, and we have incorporated the MVVM structure into our project!
The code is very similar to what we already had in our Partner Lab 2, but with some additions and the code being separated
into different files (Card, CardView, ContentView, and MemoryGameViewModel).
It was definitely very interesting to use the MVVM structure, but definitely helped us out when it came to organization.
Besides the new animation, our game is the same as last time, but we hope you enjoy it!!

Animation:


Hello! This is our app, and we have added a new animation, spring!!
This animation occurs when you press the "New Game" button.
It adds a nice, fun touch and really engages players to keep playing!
We wanted to add this and the original ease in/out animations because of how fun they are,
along with how interesting they look in the game. They really stood out to us when we were learning about animations in Swift.
We already had the ease animations to add a little "bedazzle" to the game, which we thought looked really nice.
These ease animations are seen throughout the MemoryGameViewModel, ContentView, and CardView files! (Apologies, my XCode was acting out so that's why it can't be seen much in the video!!)
So, we wanted to add another one, spring!
We, Taina and Tori, hope that you find this game enjoyable!
